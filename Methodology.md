So I think I can use my contacts app as a base point for the book app!

#### Element Similarities

| Contacts Have: | Books Have: |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Name           | Title  /  Author |
| Email          | Category |
| Photo          | Photo |


#### Function Similarities

| Functions: | Needed: |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Search     | Search |
| Add        | n/a |
| Delete     | n/a |
| Link to a new page | Link to a new page |
| n/a        | modify element (category) |


### Is it really as simple as copying the work we've done in class?

Probable steps:
1. Replacing the classnames 'contact-\*' with 'book-\*'.
1. Cutting and pasting the 'contact search' BAR to the 'book search' PAGE
  * (best to think of the purpose of this PAGE as a 'search then add' function.).
1. Replacing the `<a> tag` with a `<link> tag`.

I've checked in with my mentor; this approach has a name called 'Patterning' and is often taught in formal Programming courses.

I'm going to try it!
