## Project Submission

### Submission Instructions
Please verify that your project adheres to our [HTML](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/index.html), [CSS](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/css.html), [JavaScript](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html), and [Git](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/) style guidelines.

If you chose to develop your project in your Workspace, you can submit directly from your Workspace. When you're ready to submit, go to your Workspace and just click the "Submit Project" button. That's all there is to it!

If you chose to develop on your local machine (by either starting with the starter project or starting from scratch with Create React App), you will need to:
* Push your project to GitHub, making sure to push the `master` branch.
* On the project submission page choose the option "Submit with GitHub"
* Select the repository for this project (you may need to connect your GitHub account first).
