Developing a large project is hard. Don't just dive in and try to tackle the entire thing all at once. As the famous saying goes:

> A goal without a plan is just a wish.

Start with a plan! Here are some steps that I like to follow when building a project:

* outline the steps needed to build the project
* draw the application
  * what individual screens would look like
  * how the Components are connected to each other
* write down the architecture
* develop the app piece by piece

And just before submitting:

* squash all bugs
* check the rubric and make sure that your project meets all requirements

Take it slow and practice your newly acquired skills. You've got this! 🙌🏼
